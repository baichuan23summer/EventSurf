# SeminarSurf
we’re excited to introduce SeminarSurf, a platform designed to eliminate the hassle of keeping up with academic seminars during a busy quarter. Whether you're juggling coursework, extracurriculars, or research, SeminarSurf personalizes your seminar experience, so you can focus on learning and growing in your field.

As students, we’ve all been there—scrolling through outdated department emails, trying to remember seminar dates, and missing out on relevant events because we just couldn’t keep track. With all the demands of a quarter, staying updated on seminars shouldn’t be an additional stress. Unfortunately, the current platforms like Shoreline or department websites are fragmented, difficult to navigate, and don't offer personalized suggestions based on your academic and career goals. This leaves many students missing out on valuable opportunities.

 

That’s where SeminarSurf comes in. We built a one-stop platform to help you easily discover, track, and organize seminars that align with your interests, career aspirations, and goals—all in one place. SeminarSurf uses the users uploaded pdf and a prompted generative AI to deliver personalized seminar recommendations that make the process seamless.

First we have Simplified Seminar Hosting: If you're hosting a seminar, SeminarSurf offers an easy-to-fill-out form that automatically generates a PDF and can be sent directly to the event coordinator. No more scrambling to send emails or follow-ups—everything is automated.

Next up is Personalized Seminar Recommendations: Simply upload your resume, and SeminarSurf analyzes your academic background and career path to recommend relevant seminars. We use prompt engineering to understand your academic interests using the openai api and recommend seminars we webscraped from several sources including shoreline and department websites. Whether you're looking to expand your knowledge in a specific area or improve your professional skills, this page will suggest seminars with a tailored reason.

Smart Event Tracking: Our “My Events” feature lets you store and organize all the seminars you’ve attended, hosted, or want to join. This ensures you never miss a seminar again and allows you to easily keep track of your academic and professional journey.

Building SeminarSurf wasn’t without its challenges. One of the biggest hurdles we faced was the scarcity and inconsistency of seminar data. To address this, we scraped data from sources like Shoreline and the UCSB Data Science Activity list, but the data was often fragmented and lacked key details. We leveraged OpenAI's API to clean up and structure the data, and then used its powerful language models to generate intelligent recommendations based on career paths.

Looking ahead, our goal is to make SeminarSurf the go-to platform for academic seminars at UCSB. We want to create a personalized, user-friendly experience that not only helps students discover seminars but also track their progress, review seminars, and even create seminar schedules with the help of AI.

In the future, we hope to integrate SeminarSurf with UCSB’s existing systems, like Shoreline, to further streamline the seminar discovery process and make it easier for students to stay on top of their academic growth.
